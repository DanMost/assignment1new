  		<h3><tt>English language.</tt></h3>
  		    <p>Learning English language has become a sufficient part of my life, because I have been doing that for approximately <strong>14 years</strong>. I started it when I was 6 years old. Firstly I was studying with a private teacher and <br> continued till I was 13. After this I visited additional IELTS courses at school and, it continued until I passed IELTS. In this test I scored 7.5 points. In my opinion, knowledge of English language simplified my life <br> because in 11 and 12 grades I was studying in English and now I am given lectures in the university also in English.</p>
